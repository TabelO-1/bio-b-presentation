            Puberty:
            <p>
              Puberty is associated with other expirences that can play a role
              in depression. Some examples are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Emerging sexuality and identity issues
                <li>Conflicts with parents</li>
                <li>
                  Increasing pressure to achieve in school, sports or other
                  areas of life
                </li>

            Pregnant:
            <p>
              Dramatic hormonal changes occur during pregnancy, and these can
              affect mood. Other issues also may increase the risk of developing
              depression during pregnancy or during attempts to become pregnant,
              such as:
              <ul>
                Lifestyle or work changes or other life stressors
                <li>Relationship problems</li>
                <li>
                  Previous episodes of depression, postpartum depression or PMDD
                </li>
                <li>Lack of social support</li>
                <li>Unintended or unwanted pregnancy</li>
                <li>Miscarriage</li>
                <li>Infertility</li>
                <li>topping use of antidepressant medications</li>

            Postpartum depression:
            <p>
              But more-serious or long-lasting depressed feelings may indicate
              postpartum depression, particularly if signs and symptoms include:
              <ul>
                <li>Crying more often than usual</li>
                <li>Low self-esteem or feeling like you're a bad mom</li>
                <li>Anxiety or feeling numb</li>
                <li>Trouble sleeping, even when your baby is sleeping</li>
                <li>Problems with daily functioning</li>
                <li>Inability to care for your baby</li>
                <li>Thoughts of harming your baby</li>
                <li>Thoughts of suicide</li>
              </ul>
              <br></br>
              Postpartum depression is a serious medical condition requiring
              prompt treatment. It occurs in about 10 to 15 percent of women.
              It's thought to be associated with:
              <ul>
                <li>Major hormonal fluctuations that influence mood</li>
                <li>The responsibility of caring for a newborn</li>
                <li>Predisposition to mood and anxiety disorders</li>
                <li>Pregnancy and birth complications</li>
                <li>Breast-feeding problems</li>
                <li>Infant complications or special needs</li>
                <li>Poor social support</li>
              </ul>

            Life Circumstance and Culture:
            <p>
              The higher rate of depression in women isn't due to biology alone.
              Life circumstances and cultural stressors can play a role, too.
              Although these stressors also occur in men, it's usually at a
              lower rate. Factors that may increase the risk of depression in
              women include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <bold>Unequal power and status.</bold> Women are much more
                  likely than men to live in poverty, causing concerns such as
                  uncertainty about the future and decreased access to community
                  and health care resources. These issues can cause feelings of
                  negativity, low self-esteem and lack of control over life.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <bold>Work overload.</bold> Often women work outside the home
                  and still handle home responsibilities. Many women deal with
                  the challenges of single parenthood, such as working multiple
                  jobs to make ends meet. Also, women may be caring for their
                  children while also caring for sick or older family members.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <bold>Sexual or physical abuse.</bold> Women who were
                  emotionally, physically or sexually abused as children or
                  adults are more likely to experience depression at some point
                  in their lives than those who weren't abused. Women are more
                  likely than men to experience sexual abuse.
