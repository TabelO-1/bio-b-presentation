            <p>
              In general, depression is caused by an imbalance in brain
              chemistry. Important neurotransmitters such as dopamine and
              serotonin may not be produced in enough abundance in the human
              brain. Depression can be treated on a pharmacological level, where
              medications are introduced, and these drugs can help restore the
              correct levels of neurotransmitters in the brain.

              food. Avoid foods high in refined sugar and foods packed with
              saturated fats. Incorporate healthy foods into your diet,
